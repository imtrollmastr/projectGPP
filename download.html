        <h3>Geolocation Private Processer (GPP)</h3>
        <p>Geolocation Private Processor, also known as GPP, is a Python-based software that processes information from a IP address to geolocation information. Instead of taking different APIs, the GPP puts them altogether and gives you the most precise and best information. All information is not stored, and will be removed at the end of your session. The program is still in beta, please expect bugs and slow API requests.</p>
        
        <h4><a href="geolocator.py">Download the geolocation file.</a></h4>
        <p>You will not be able to use GPP until you are given a Json file that contains your credentials to access GPP.</p>
        <p>Please email imtrollmastr <a href="mailto:eddiestockton420@gmail.com">here</a> to get the JSON file.</p>

        <h5>How to use GPP</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, you will need an IP address. This IP address can be found by using a IP grabber.</li>
            <li>Ask a friend or family member to enter the website generated by the IP grabber.</li>
            <li>The IP address of your friend or family member will show up on your view of the IP grabber.</li>
            <li>Load GPP.</li>
            <li>Input the IP address into the terminal.</li>
            <li>You will receive the geolocation of the friend or family member.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
        <p>The information provided should be used for educational purposes only. To avoid being IP grabbed, use a VPN such as NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN, Surfshark, etc. </p>
